<h1 id="what-is-matter">What is Matter</h1>
<p>Matter is anything that has weight and takes space. Examples include my laptop, the air I breed and … Everything My laptop has weight (Trust me, I have to carry it around sometimes) and it takes space. It takes up space on my desk, in my bag, … Everywhere. So, m laptop is a form of matter.</p>
<p>Matters are made up of atoms of elements. E.g. The air I breed contains several gasses, including Oxygen, Nitrogen and Carbon Di-oxide. All these gasses are made up of elements, E.G. Carbon Di-Oxide is made up of Carbon and Oxygen. My laptop’s processor is made up of silicon.</p>
<p>A matter could appear like a particle at a moment and act as a wave in another moment. This is known as wave-particle duality.</p>
<h2 id="state-of-matter">State of Matter</h2>
<p>Earlier, I was thought matter has three state (Solid, Liquid and Gas). Now, I have learned there are more states. For my level, I’m adding plasma into the list. A plasma is like a gas, excepts the fact that it has charge. The charge is not bound to an atom or ion, it is free. Let’s go through each of these briefly:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Solid</strong>: A matter in this state has a definite shape and volume. This is because the particles (molecules) of the matter are packed together and moves very slowly.This movement is in the form of oscillation and vibration. Example include my laptop (again), my fingers, my desk, my bed, sand, wood, ice…<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Liquid</strong>: A liquid has a definite volume but takes the shape of it’s container. Water in a cup is not cylindrical in shape, it’s the cup that is cylindrical. If I pour the water in the cup to bowl, it takes the shape of the bowl. Apart from the small parts of the water that will be lost in the process, the volume of the water is largely the same. A liquid has a definite volume.</li>
<li><strong>Gas</strong>: Unlike liquids, a gas has no definite volume. This is because gas particles are in constant movements and the intermolecular forces are low. So, when you increase the volume of a container containing a gas, the gas will occupy more volume. Example of matter in gaseous state is the Air.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Plasma</strong>: As stated above, a plasma is like a gas but it has free charges that are not bound to an ion or molecule. A gas could be converted to a plasma by heating it and then ionizing it. Examples of matter in plasma state are lightning and stars.</li>
